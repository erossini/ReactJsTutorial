# What am I doing in this project?

- Route in React
- multiple pages
- login with Google
- CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)
- error handling

## Dependecies

- `react-router`: core navigation lib - we don't install this manually
- `react-router-dom`: navigation for dom-based appos (we what this!)
- `react-router-native`: navigation for `react-native` apps
- `react-router-redux`: bindings between Redux and `React Router` (not necessary)

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

We can't use the tag `a` in React applications but `Link`

```
<Link to="/newpage">Click here</Link>
```
