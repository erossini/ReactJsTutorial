# What are we doing?

We want to create an application for display photos based on the user input.

- React Refs to access `DOM` element

# Dependecies

- [Unsplash for Developers](https://unsplash.com/) reads photos for our application
- Axios (3rd party package) to call Unsplash apis
- fetch (function built into modern browsers)


## Install dependecies

```
npm install --save axios
```
